**NOTE!: THE current PROTOCOL DOESN'T WORK with indi, AND THE SERVO NEEDS TOO MUCH POWER AT STARTUP.**
I'm working on a new stepper motoro setup that will be compatible with current indi drivers.


                                 -=Ray's super simple telescope OTA cover for indi=-
  

  Parts:
  Ardunio nano     -- Or pretty much any Arduino or even a wifi module(still needs power)
  Airplane servo   -- a standard servo works with a powered usb hub. 
  Some stiff plastic sheeting, old coffee can lids etc. --to make the hat. I used aluminum flashing cut round.
  something to make the cherry picker arm that holds it. I used a scrap of metal similar to what an umbrella might have.
  Some massive wire ties, or other attachment device --I used two 6 inch hoseclamps from a dryer vent kit, 
  bent one to fit the servo then secured it with foil tape.
  or a permanant servo mount screwed to an adjustable dew cap --this was a nuisance.
  Very likely hope and some Ductape. --that metal foil tape is nice and sticky.


This sketch works with the indi_flipflat Indilib driver. Only the *open* and *close* are working, and it's apparently buggy as yet.
OTher commands may return info or placeholders.
